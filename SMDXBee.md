# Mounting XBees on the SMD Devboard


![Board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/670Mustangs/minibots/master/images/smdxbee.png)



1. Use gloves for next ops
2. Clean Xbee and SMD PCB pads with alcohol, swabs, tissues
3. Place foil on back side of SMD mount board to help cool pins and avoid reflow of solder on them
4. Center clamp Xbee in the middle to SMD mount board. Clamp horizontally to allow standing up in pan. Assure that ALL pads are aligned between Xbee and mount board +/-0.001‚Äù, then gently tighten the center clamp.
5. Use extra fine tip on solder paste (P/N 247-LOWTEMP-15, No Clean, Lead Free, Low Temp) to apply small dabs of paste to each pad. The Xbee pads have hemi-cylindrical indents which should be filled with paste. Try not to, but OK to cover more than one pad with paste, capillary attraction should clear the gap between pads.
6. Use toaster oven broiler to heat from the top while watching. Wait 15 seconds AFTER solder melts to allow good wetting. Remove from broiler immediately.
7. Cool, clean, inspect, test.
